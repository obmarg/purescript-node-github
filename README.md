purescript-node-github
--------

A purescript interface to github, based on
[node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github).

Currently a work in progress, so probably shouldn't be used for anything
important.  In particular it does not currently support authentication, or have
any real tests.  It also doesn't have any proper types defined, so you'll need
to do at your call sites.

This library should import the whole of the node github API for use by
purescript.  It's interfaces are mostly autogenerated, so there might be a few
issues.  Not the best, but it was the easiest way to wrap 200+ functions
without a whole load of work.

Use Examples
----

Each API function in purescript-github-node has the same type signature:

    type ApiFn = forall a b. Client -> { | a} -> Thunk { | b}

The first argument - `Client` can be created by calling `makeClient`:

    client = makeClient {version: "3.0.0"}

makeClient takes the same parameters as the GitHubApi constructor from
node-github.

This client can then be passed to an API function, which will return a
Node.Thunk.  A full example can be found in examples/example.purs
